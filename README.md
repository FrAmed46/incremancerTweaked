# Incremancer
Idle Necromancer Game

I have made this fork in order to make some changes that make the game more enjoyable for me (you probably won't agree)

Also as an amateur programmer i would love to learn how the game works and tinker with it

## CHANGES FROM CIRUSDANE'S INCREMANCER (So far)

### Equipment 
Added 2 new equipment types (ring and armband)
### Formulas
Shiny! upgrade now gives 4% increase per level, it is not as bad as it looks.

Made the skeleton levelling formula slightly softer (1k*level^2 to 800*level^1.9)

loot drop base chance 25% higher, added more "tiers" to the scaling. (now it is not just current level higher than double skeleton level or lower than skeleton)

loot upgrade chances changed : common to rare increased to 25%, epic to legendary increased to 12.5%, ancient to divine increased to 12.5%  (without shiny, makes divine from 1 in 256k to 1 in 12.8k)

Equipment destruction now gives very slowly scaling exponential xp, since it was worthless before

Slightly lowered the scaling of prestige upgrades (the 20% income and storage scale by 1.125 per level instead of 1.15)

Slightly lowered and changed the base price of talent points (100-> 95 and scales by 1.17 per level instead of 1.175)

### Miscellaneous
Fence is 33% bigger!
