# Incremancer
Idle Necromancer Game

I have made this fork in order to make some changes that make the game more enjoyable for me (you probably won't agree)

Also as an amateur programmer i would love to learn how the game works and tinker with it

CHANGES FROM CIRUSDANE'S INCREMANCER (So far):
Added 2 new equipment types (ring and armband)
Made the skeleton levelling formula slightly softer (1k*level^2 to 800*level^1.9)

Looting changes: base chance 25% higher, added more "tiers" to the scaling. (now it is not just current level higher than double skeleton level or lower than skeleton)
common to rare increased to 25%, epic to legendary increased to 12.5%, ancient to divine increased to 12.5%  (without the shiny upgrade, makes divine from in in 256k to 1 in 12.8k)
Shiny! upgrade now gives 4% increase per level, it is not as bad as it looks.
